Here is some info about my education :)

I am a 5th-year student at SPbSUE in the direction of customs administration. I have been studying Python and Data Science since August 2021 and also interested in scraping(parsing). In parallel with my studies, I am studying at the online courses of gееkbrains, also doing sport. I really like active sports, reading books and team computer games like cs or dota. I am a sociable and cheerful person, curious and purposeful, I get great pleasure from overcoming difficult tasks.

HARD SKILLS:

1. Python (great), SQL (cool), NoSQL, Git, Linux;
2. NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Xpath, Scrapy and some other relevante libraries;
3. Basic machine learning algorithms such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, cluster analysis, TimeSeriesAnalys, Random Forest, Boosting algorithms;
4. NLP, ;
5. Technical English (B1-B2);
6. Linear algebra (5), statistics (5);
I have some experience in IT. I have some EDA skills, I have worked with real estate price analysis, using CatBoost, XGBoost and so on. I've read the books: Bhargava Aditya “Algorithms of the Player. Guide. An illustrated guide for programmers and the curious”, Michael Dawson “Programming in Python”, Mathis Eric “Learning Python. Game Programming, Data visualization, Web Applications”, Andreas Muller, Sarah Guido “Introduction to Machine Learning using Python. A guide for data specialists.”. I have also have trained on Kaggle training datasets. In the near future, I plan to improve my knowledge in mathematical analysis and probability theory, as well as learn the second programming language java script. The work as a junior ds are a great chance for me to gain more experience on real data and improve my skils. Hope get some feedback :)
